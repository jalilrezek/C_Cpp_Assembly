# C_Cpp_Assembly
Projects implemented in C, C++, and Assembly Language. The most salient ones are:
1) a chess game implemented in C++ with heavily object-oriented design, and
2) an image processor in C and Assembly, allowing functionalities such as mirroring images, applying a grayscale effect, and blending two images together.
