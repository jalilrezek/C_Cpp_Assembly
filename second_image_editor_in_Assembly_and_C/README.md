# DIRECTIONS

The most important files are in the "assembly_implementation", "C_implementation", and "unit_tests" folders. 

The actual image processing functions are visible in the "assembly_implementation" and "C_implementation folders."

The "unit_tests" folder contains unit tests used to verify processing functionality.

The "execution" folder runs the program with rigorous error handling.

The "image_struct_functions" folder defines the Image struct used throughout the programs and crucial associated functions.

The "png_usage" folder is not very important but defines some important functions for working with images in PNG format.
