# DIRECTIONS

"image_editing/image_manip.c" contains the essential image editing functions, implemented manually. They are:
    Rotation
    Grayscaling
    Saturation
    Blending two images
    Pointilism (an artistic effect that speckles the image with black dots of varying radii)

"execution/project.c" runs the program, with thorough error handling. 

ppm_io.c and ppm_io.h are involved in reading in the images which must be in the PPM format.
